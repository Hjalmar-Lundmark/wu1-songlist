            <p>Eternal rains will come<br>
                We should say goodbye<br>
                And suffer on our own<br>
                As all our thoughts were wrong<br>
                <br>
                So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through<br>
                And when the flood comes to drown us<br>
                There is nothing we can do<br>
                <br>
                You told me not to wait<br>
                Unless I could wait forever<br>
                Because there is no time for us<br>
                Take comfort in what was<br>
                <br>
                So hard to keep the darkness from seeping through<br>
                And when the flood comes to drown us<br>
                There is nothing we can do<br>
                
                Here it comes, our death comes<br>
                And in my sleep I can't forget<br>
                <br>
                Reaching for the surface, I see you</p>

            <h3>"Cusp of Eternity"</h3>
            <p>A child of autumn was born<br>
                Into a world of deceit and death<br>
                And a land of ice<br>
                A break of bonds would take her away<br>
                And install a sense of loss and eternal sorrow<br>
                <br>
                She walks across the country<br>
                She holds her head up high in the rain<br>
                A mother is screaming for help<br>
                And she turns around to stare<br>
                At a scene from her memory<br>
                <br>
                She is hiding a wish in her heart<br>
                That flows through her blood always<br>
                And it's culled from a dream<br>
                That someone is waiting to say her name<br>
                And call her to his side at the cusp of eternity</p>

            <h3>"Moon Above, Sun Below"</h3>
            <p>You are sleeping unhampered by guilt<br>
                Comes the morning you shut down<br>
                The devil's breath is a disease on your lips<br>
                Reaching out for your loss<br>
                You prey on your flock<br>
                <br>
                Seeking out the weaker hearts<br>
                With eternity in your grip<br>
                And on a lifelong throne of sub-religion<br>
                They will eat from your hand<br>
                <br>
                With the moon above and the sun below<br>
                <br>
                I can't remember the sun upon my skin<br>
                Slave to a sorrow that is whispering within<br>
                I'm always waiting for you before I sleep<br>
                There is no comfort in the distance that we keep<br>
                <br>
                In a river of grief I am drowning<br>
                And your grip is surrounding my heart<br>
                Balancing on the edge of failure<br>
                And relieved, should I fall<br>
                Scattered dust upon my eyes<br>
                A winding road taking you nowhere<br>
                A winding road taking me home<br>
                And my home is my grave<br>
                <br>
                Waiting for a day when there is nothing left to say<br>
                <br>
                Voices of despair is a familiar friendship<br>
                A society in your head holds the code to destruction<br>
                <br>
                Dying fast<br>
                Summer dying fast<br>
                And this can't last, as nothing ever lasts<br>
                In a forest of flesh<br>
                There is a need to sever myself away from happiness<br>
                <br>
                Still no drifting sun<br>
                Black upon the earth<br>
                Still the air is dry<br>
                And the locust wait<br>
                <br>
                There is no help in the wake of our needs<br>
                There is no help to dispel the pain<br>
                There is no help yet some cling to a phantom<br>
                There is no help, only circles on the water<br>
                <br>
                Only circles on the water</p>

            <p>What is left when the morning comes<br>
                Is the memory of a future<br>
                And when my plight is done<br>
                There is nothing left to hold on to<br>
                <br>
                There were friends waiting at my door<br>
                They are gone now, for the year is new<br>
                I stuck by my word<br>
                And when the rains came<br>
                Made it true and pure, to dissolve the hurt<br>
                <br>
                Are we nursing destruction?<br>
                Pursuing a dream we once had<br>
                Was it our intention<br>
                to follow this road 'til the end<br>
                Even if the end is a world of sorrow?<br>
                <br>
                There is a bond between us<br>
                Even if it's frayed it is unbreakable<br>
                So I come for you always<br>
                And I welcome pain<br>
                For a second of belonging somewhere<br>
                There were times when I lost my way<br>
                With hope pouring from my soul<br>
                In a shelter from the sun<br>
                I don't want to bare my scars for you</p>
